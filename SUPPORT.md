# Server Software Policy

## Supported Versions

I officially support **Spigot or subsets of it**. When you'd like to request support for **another software** than Spigot (or subsets/forks of it), 
feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/axelrindle/Broadcaster-Plugin/issues/new?title=Support+Request+for+SERVER_SOFTWARE_HERE).

Please be aware that support for older version might be dropped **at any time**. Assume that roughly the latest 4 version of Spigot (or subsets/forks of it) are supported.

Note that this document always applies to the **latest released version of the plugin**.
